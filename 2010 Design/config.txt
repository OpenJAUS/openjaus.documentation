Config procedure:
	1. Attempt configure at component level
		- if address complete set address and return (any 0 octet means incomplete: ex 0.2.1 still needs subs number)
	2. Attempt to configure at node level interface
		- if address complete set and return
	3. If component has subs interface
			- Attempt to configure subs level address
			- if address complete then set and return
			- else assume first cmpt on system 1.1.1, set and return
	   else If static subs config set and return
	   else wait and continue to query node server or node broadcast


Server Based Configuration Attempt:

	1. Configuration client service starts up
	2. Client loads Server UDP address from file
	3. Creates new configuration address request message (which extends JUDP Message)
	4. Sets the UDP address to server address
	5. Sends config request direct to JUDP transport interface
	
	... wait for server ... 
		if timeout, then send request again
	
	6. Response from server comes in on JUDP interface
	7. Gets unpacked into request response message
	8. Gets put onto receive queue for service
	9. Caught by configuration client service
	10. Client sets JAUS Address of component
